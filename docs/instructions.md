# Assignment 4 – IRobot

## Value (%)

This assignment is worth 10% of your course grade.

## Task

You will implement the Command design pattern using interfaces in C#. You will be given a `Robot` class and a set of command classes that inherit from an abstract class. Your task is to:

1. Replace the abstract class with an interface.
2. Recreate the existing command classes to implement the new interface.
3. Update the `Robot` class to use the new interface.
4. Design and implement a new command class.
5. Write unit tests for the `Robot` class and command classes.
6. Create a `RobotTester` class that allows user input to load and execute robot commands.

## How to Complete This Assessment

Follow these steps to complete the assignment:

1. Create an `IRobotCommand` interface in the InterfaceCommand.cs file and define the `Run` method signature in it. This will replace the `RobotCommand` abstract class.
2. Recreate the existing command classes (`OffCommand`, `OnCommand`, `WestCommand`, `EastCommand`, `SouthCommand`, and `NorthCommand`) to implement the `IRobotCommand` interface instead of inheriting from the `RobotCommand` abstract class. Update their `Run` method implementations as necessary.
3. Update the `Robot` class to use the `Assignment.InterfaceCommand` namespace in place of the `Assignment.AbstractCommand` namespace.
4. **Complete the XML documentation within the `Robot` class**.
5. Design and implement a new command class that implements the `IRobotCommand` interface. This new command should perform a unique action on the robot.
6. Write unit tests to cover the `Robot` class and the command classes, ensuring that the implemented commands work correctly and the robot behaves as expected.
7. Create a new `RobotTester` class that allows the user to input strings via the console to load robot commands. This tester class should:
    - Prompt the user to enter command strings
    - Convert the input strings into command objects
    - Load the commands into a robot instance
    - Run the robot, displaying the robot's state after each command execution
8. Test your implementation using the `RobotTester` class to ensure everything works as expected.

## How to Submit Your Assessment
